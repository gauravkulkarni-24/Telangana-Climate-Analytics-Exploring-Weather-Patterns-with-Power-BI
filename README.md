# 🌦️ Telangana Weather Analysis — Power BI Climate Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** that explores Telangana’s weather patterns from **2021–2024** using real historical data.

Instead of just creating charts, this project turns data into a **story — one that helps you *understand climate trends*** and **draw meaningful insights** across the state.

Using Power BI, I built an interactive environment where you can explore rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends across districts, seasons, and time.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📊 Explore weather patterns across Telangana from multiple perspectives  
- 🔎 Understand how major weather parameters change with time and location  
- 📌 Support decision-making for sectors like agriculture, environment, planning, and disaster response  
- 🧠 Learn Power BI modeling, data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling

## 📂 What’s Inside

### 1️⃣ Weather Data (Raw)
This folder contains **4 separate CSV files** representing weather data across multiple years.  
Each file includes data such as:
- Date  
- District  
- Rainfall  
- Temperature (Min/Max)  
- Humidity (Min/Max)
- Wind Speed (Min/Max)

---

### 2️⃣ Cleaned & Merged Dataset
This is a **cleaned and combined dataset** (created by merging the 4 raw files) using EDA techniques.  
It contains:
- Consistent & corrected data types  
- No missing values  
- Ready for visualization in Power BI

---

### 3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
📌 **Telangana Weather Analysis.pbix** — The main interactive file built using Power BI Desktop.

It includes:
- Filters for year, district, season, and more
- Clean visuals and KPIs
- Comparisons across time and location
